# Zero-knowledge-demo
Welcome to the Zero Knowledge Proof Demo repository. This Python implementation showcases a simplified example of a zero knowledge proof, a fascinating concept in cryptography. Zero knowledge proofs allow one party to prove a statement's truth to another party without revealing any specific information about the statement itself. In other words, it enables the prover to convince the verifier of a fact without disclosing underlying data. This README provides an overview of zero knowledge proofs, a description of the demo, instructions for usage, installation details, and information about contributing and licensing.
